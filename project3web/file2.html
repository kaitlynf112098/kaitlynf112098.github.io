Dianne Ferrer stayed up “until the wee hours of the morning” constructing a New York Sightseeing bus for her four French bulldogs, Harley (pictured), Baby, Dakota and Gus.

“They’re French tourists because they’re Frenchie’s,” she said. “We had to rent a truck to bring it because it wouldn’t fit in my S.U.V.”

The Black Parade

(When I was a young boy)<br>
(My father took me into the city)<br>
(To see a marching band)<br>
(He said, "Son, when you grow up)<br>
(Would you be the savior of the broken)<br>
(The beaten and the damned?")<br>
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me<br>
And other times I feel like I should go<br>
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets<br>
And when you're gone, we want you all to know<br>
We'll carry on<br>
We'll carry on<br>
And though you're dead and gone believe me<br>
