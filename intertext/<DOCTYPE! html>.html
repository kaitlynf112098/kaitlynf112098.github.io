All the Good Pups at the 
<br>Halloween Dog Parade 
<br>
<br>
<div class='text1'>
Halloween in New York is terrifying. Haunted houses pop up throughout the five boroughs, subway cars swell with all kinds of characters and, scariest of all, interminable lines for parties snake around city blocks.

But the week leading up to Halloween in New York? <a href="dogpic.html"> Adorable.</a> This year, the  <a href="paradepic.html"> Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade </a>  drew 500 canines and an estimated 25,000 humans to the East Village. Here are some of the good boys and girls who braved the unseasonably warm fall day in full costume.

The Black Parade
<br> 
<div class='text2'> 
When I was a young boy <br>
My father took me into the city<br>
To see a marching band<br>
He said, "Son, when you grow up<br>
Would you be the savior of the broken<br>
The beaten and the damned?"<br>
He said, "Will you defeat them<br>
Your demons, and all the non-believers<br>
The plans that they have made?"<br>
"Because one day I'll leave you<br>
A phantom to lead you in the summer<br>
To join the black parade."<br>
