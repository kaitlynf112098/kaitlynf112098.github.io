The Black Parade

(When I was a young boy)<br>
(My father took me into the city)<br>
(To see a marching band)<br>
(He said, "Son, when you grow up)<br>
(Would you be the savior of the broken)<br>
(The beaten and the damned?")<br>
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me<br>
And other times I feel like I should go<br>
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets<br>
And when you're gone, we want you all to know<br>
We'll carry on<br>
We'll carry on<br>
And though you're dead and gone believe me<br>
