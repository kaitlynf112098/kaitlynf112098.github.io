Friends Diana Lucchi, left, and Asha Vereen built a saltwater aquarium for their three dogs, who took home first place in the costume competition. They are, from left, Giupetto, as an angelfish, Gianna, as a lion fish, and Penelope as a clownfish.

The Black Parade
<div class='text23'> 
Your memory will carry on<br>
We'll carry on<br>
And in my heart I can't contain it<br>
The anthem won't explain it<br>
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams<br>
Your misery and hate will kill us all<br>
So paint it black and take it back<br>
Let's shout it loud and clear<br>
Defiant to the end we hear the call<br>
To carry on<br>
We'll carry on<br>
And though you're dead and gone believe me<br>
Your memory will carry on<br>
We'll carry on<br>
And though you're broken and defeated<br>
Your weary widow marches
On and on we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
